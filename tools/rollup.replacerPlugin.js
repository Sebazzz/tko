/**
 * Resolve the path of tko.* packages, so
 *
 *    tko.utils   =>   packages/tko.utils/src/index.js
 *
 * We use sources so that we don't have multiple references
 * from different sources e.g. `tko.computed` and `tko.observable`
 * both importing `tko.utils` would generate multiple versions
 * of objectMap that rollup transpiles as objectMap$1 and
 * objectMap$2.
 *
 * Plus by doing this we won't need to rebuild dist/ files
 * whenever we make changes to the source.
